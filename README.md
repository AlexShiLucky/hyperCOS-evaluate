The hyperC OS is a real time-operating system (RTOS) designed for various IoT applications.

While most of the commercial RTOSs focus on standards and features of general
CPUs, the hyperCOS have narrowed down the scope of its design in order to build
a solid and niche foundation for our software. All the designs are aimed at the
optimization of ARM Cortex CPUs. The software architecture supports and utilizes
the specific features of ARM Cortex CPUs, the Cortex-M, Cortex-R and Cortex-A series.
It's the specialty on Cortex CPU that brings the competitive advantage over the others.

The HyperCOS design disciplines are:

* Optimizing over general
* Simplifying over complex
